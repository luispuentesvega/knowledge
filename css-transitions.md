### CSS 

## Transitions
CSS transitions provide a way to control **animation speed** when changing **css properties**. \
For example, if you want to change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous.\
With CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time interval that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.
